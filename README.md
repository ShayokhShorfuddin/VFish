# VFish
Vfish is a lightweight interpreter for Deadfish, an esoteric programming language. Deadfish was originally introduced by 'Camto' in a video, where he demonstrated how a Brainf*ck interpreter works behind the scenes. I found the concept fascinating and decided to build my own interpreter using Vlang.
