# VFish
Vfish is a tiny interpreter for Deadfish, an esoteric programming language which was used to demonstrate how Brainf*ck interpreter works behind the scene. 'Camto' originally came up with the idea of Deadfish in his video which I found pretty interesting. So, I built a lightweight interpreter using Vlang.
